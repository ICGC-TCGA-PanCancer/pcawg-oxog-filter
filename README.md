# pcawg-oxog-filter
The CWL workflow to execute the OxoG filter _only_. For a workflow that runs PCAWG OxoG Filter, PCAWG Annotation, and generates Minibams, see this repository:  https://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/OxoG-Dockstore-Tools

The original SeqWare workflow can be found here: https://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/OxoGWrapperWorkflow
The Seqware workflow runs: the OxoG filter, produces mini-bams, and also runs Jonathan Dursi's PCAWG Annotator.
